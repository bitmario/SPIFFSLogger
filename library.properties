sentence=A minimal library for binary data logging in ESP8266.
paragraph=Makes it easy to read, write and keep logs of relevant data, such as sensor readings in an efficient way, by storing data in raw, binary format along with a time_t. Depending on the data, this should offer about 50% space savings vs. saving the same data in CSV. Daily file rotation is performed automatically.
